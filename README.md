# PRODIGY_DS_04-Twitter-Sebtimental-Analysis
# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This repository is dedicated to performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets and classify them based on sentiment, which can be positive, negative, or neutral. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the sentiment of a given tweet.

# Files
Sentimental analysis on twitter.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the entire workflow for performing sentiment analysis. It covers data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and prediction of sentiment based on tweet data.

twitter_training.csv: The dataset used for training the sentiment analysis model. It contains tweets with their corresponding sentiment labels, which serve as the target variable.

# Key Steps in the Project
1. Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning: Removed unwanted characters, special symbols, and URLs from the tweets.
Tokenization: Split the text into individual words (tokens) for analysis.
Stopword Removal: Removed common words (like "the", "is", "in") that do not contribute to sentiment.
Stemming and Lemmatization: Converted words to their base forms to reduce redundancy.
2. Feature Extraction
Bag of Words (BoW): Represented the text data numerically using the Bag of Words approach.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Applied TF-IDF to weigh the importance of words in the dataset.
N-grams: Considered consecutive word combinations to capture word context in sentences.
3. Model Building
Classification Models: Used several machine learning algorithms, such as:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusted model parameters to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.
4. Model Evaluation
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score: Evaluated the models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Confusion Matrix: Generated a confusion matrix to visualize model performance and misclassifications.
Cross-Validation: Applied k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's reliability and generalization.
5. Sentiment Prediction
Prediction on New Tweets: Used the trained model to predict sentiment on unseen Twitter data.
Performance Assessment: Assessed how well the model performs on new tweets by comparing predicted sentiment with true labels.
# Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.

NLTK & spaCy: Natural language processing libraries for text processing.

Scikit-learn: Used for building and evaluating machine learning models.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data and model performance.

Jupyter Notebook: Used to document and run the entire workflow.
